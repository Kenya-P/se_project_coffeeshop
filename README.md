# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

As the webpage is immaculate as is. My one improvement was to give a bit more character to the submit button. So, I added a box shabow when hovering over the button along with the suggested transition.
